Alright, so I've been trying to wrap my head around this Kryptos puzzle, specifically passage 4. It's been a bit frustrating because everyone seems to think it's super hard, but the user is saying it's actually easy and that even someone not great at math like me can figure it out. So, I'm going to give it another shot, keeping in mind the clues and trying to think like the artist, Jim Sanborn.

First off, I know that passages 1-3 have been solved using various cipher techniques, like Vigenère and transposition. Passage 4 is still a mystery, and there are specific clues provided by Sanborn himself. The clues are:

- "NYPVTT" decrypts to "BERLIN"

- "MZFPK" decrypts to "CLOCK"

- "QQPRNGKSS" decrypts to "NORTHEAST"

- "FLRV" decrypts to "EAST"

Additionally, Sanborn mentioned that the fourth passage is a riddle that leads to something else, and he hinted about delving into "that particular clock" in Berlin, although he mentioned there are several interesting clocks there.

Given that, I need to figure out what cipher or method Sanborn used for passage 4. Since the first three passages used different methods, it's possible that passage 4 uses something entirely different or a combination of methods.

Let me look at the ciphertext for passage 4 again:

"OBKR UOXOGHULBSOLIFBBWFLRVQQPRNGKSSO TWTQSJQSSEKZZWATJKLUDIAWINFBNYP VTTMZFPKWGDKZXTJCDIGKUHUAUEKCAR"

I know that "NYPVTT" becomes "BERLIN", "MZFPK" becomes "CLOCK", "QQPRNGKSS" becomes "NORTHEAST", and "FLRV" becomes "EAST". These seem to be embedded within the ciphertext, so perhaps there's a substitution cipher at play here.

One thing that's interesting is that "K" in "MZFPK" maps to "K" in "CLOCK". So, sometimes letters might map to themselves, which is unusual in many ciphers but could be a clue.

Also, Sanborn mentioned that passage 4 contains a riddle that leads to something else, which might mean that the decrypted text is another clue or leads to a physical location, perhaps related to the Berlin Clock.

Given that, maybe the cipher is based on the Berlin Clock's design or operation. The Mengenlehreuhr, or Berlin Clock, displays time using lights in a unique arrangement:

- 4 rows of lights:

- The top row has 4 red lights for hours.

- The next row has 4 red lights for the first 20 minutes.

- The third row has 11 green lights for the remaining minutes.

- The bottom row has a green light that flashes every second.

Perhaps the number of lights or their arrangement can be used to create a cipher or key.

Another angle is that Sanborn might have used a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the ciphertext is shifted based on the number of lights in each row or some other aspect of the clock.

Let me consider a basic substitution cipher first. If "NYPVTT" decrypts to "BERLIN", I can try to find the shift for each letter:

N -> B: N(14) to B(2), shift of -12

Y -> E: Y(25) to E(5), shift of -20

P -> R: P(16) to R(18), shift of +2

V -> L: V(22) to L(12), shift of -10

T -> I: T(20) to I(9), shift of -11

T -> N: T(20) to N(14), shift of -6

These shifts don't follow a consistent pattern, so it's probably not a simple Caesar shift.

Maybe it's a keyword-based Vigenère cipher. If "KRYPTOS" was used for earlier passages, perhaps a different keyword related to the clock is used here.

Alternatively, considering the clock's time display, maybe each letter is shifted based on the current time or a specific time related to the sculpture's creation.

But that seems too vague. Let's think differently.

Sanborn also mentioned that "only WW knows" in passage 2, possibly referring to William Webster, the then CIA director. Maybe "WW" is a key or part of the cipher.

However, focusing back on the clues:

- "NYPVTT" -> "BERLIN"

- "MZFPK" -> "CLOCK"

- "QQPRNGKSS" -> "NORTHEAST"

- "FLRV" -> "EAST"

If I can find a pattern in how these letters map, I might be able to apply it to the rest of the ciphertext.

Looking at "NYPVTT" to "BERLIN":

N -> B

Y -> E

P -> R

V -> L

T -> I

T -> N

Similarly, "MZFPK" -> "CLOCK":

M -> C

Z -> L

F -> O

P -> C

K -> K

"QQPRNGKSS" -> "NORTHEAST":

Q -> N

Q -> O

P -> R

R -> T

N -> H

G -> E

K -> A

S -> S

S -> T

"FLRV" -> "EAST":

F -> E

L -> A

R -> S

V -> T

Looking at these, it seems like a monoalphabetic substitution cipher where each letter consistently maps to another letter. However, in substitution ciphers, each letter should map to only one other letter, but in "NYPVTT" -> "BERLIN", T maps to both I and N, which violates that rule. So, maybe it's a polyalphabetic cipher with multiple substitution alphabets.

Given that, perhaps it's a Vigenère cipher with a keyword related to the clock or Berlin.

Another thought: since Sanborn mentioned delving into "that particular clock" and there are several clocks in Berlin, maybe he used a specific time or date related to the sculpture's creation or another significant date.

Alternatively, perhaps the cipher is based on the positions of the lights on the Berlin Clock. For example, using the number of lights in each row to determine shift values.

The Mengenlehreuhr has:

- 4 lights for hours

- 4 lights for the first 20 minutes

- 11 lights for the remaining minutes

- 1 light for seconds

Maybe the shift values are based on these numbers: 4, 4, 11, 1.

If I group the ciphertext into segments corresponding to these numbers, maybe I can apply shifts based on them.

Let's try that.

First, group the ciphertext into blocks of 4, 4, 11, and 1 letters, repeating the pattern.

So, passage 4 is:

"OBKR UOXOGHULBSOLIFBBWFLRVQQPRNGKSSO TWTQSJQSSEKZZWATJKLUDIAWINFBNYP VTTMZFPKWGDKZXTJCDIGKUHUAUEKCAR"

Removing spaces:

"OBKRUOXOGHULBSOLIFBBWFLRVQQPRNGKSSOTWTQSJQSSEKZZWATJKLUDIAWINFBNYPVTTMZFPKWGDKZXTJCDIGKUHUAUEKCAR"

Now, group into 4,4,11,1:

OBKR UOXO GHUL B SOLI FBBW FLRV QQPR NGKS SO TW TQSJ QSSE KZZW ATJK LUDI AWIN FBNY PVTT MZFP KWGD KZXT JCDI GKUH UAUE KCAR

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I need to group the entire ciphertext into sets based on 4,4,11,1.

Total letters: let's count them.

"OBKR UOXOGHULBSOLIFBBWFLRVQQPRNGKSSO TWTQSJQSSEKZZWATJKLUDIAWINFBNYP VTTMZFPKWGDKZXTJCDIGKUHUAUEKCAR"

Removing spaces: 97 characters.

Grouping into sets of 4,4,11,1:

Set 1: 4 letters

Set 2: 4 letters

Set 3: 11 letters

Set 4: 1 letter

Repeat.

So, total sets:

4+4+11+1=20 per cycle.

97 divided by 20 is 4 full cycles (80 letters) and 17 remaining.

So, first 80 letters in groups of 4,4,11,1, and then the remaining 17 letters.

But this seems arbitrary and may not lead anywhere.

Alternative approach: consider that the Berlin Clock has 4 rows, perhaps each row corresponds to a different shift or cipher.

Alternatively, maybe the number of lights in each row (4,4,11,1) corresponds to shift values.

Let's consider shift values of 4,4,11,1.

Applying these shifts repeatedly to the ciphertext.

But again, without a clear pattern, it's tough.

Another idea: maybe the letters correspond to the positions of the lights being on or off at a specific time.

But that seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps Sanborn used the positions of the lights on the clock to create a cipher key.

Alternatively, maybe it's a book cipher, where the letters point to specific words in a book related to the clock.

But that's speculative.

Given the time constraints, maybe I should look for a simpler substitution.

Given that "NYPVTT" -> "BERLIN" and "MZFPK" -> "CLOCK", perhaps I can create a partial key based on these mappings and try to fill in the rest.

From "NYPVTT" -> "BERLIN":

N -> B

Y -> E

P -> R

V -> L

T -> I or N (inconsistent)

From "MZFPK" -> "CLOCK":

M -> C

Z -> L

F -> O

P -> C (but earlier P -> R)

Conflict here: P maps to both R and C.

This inconsistency suggests it's not a simple substitution.

Maybe it's a polyalphabetic cipher with a repeating key.

If I assume a Vigenère cipher with a keyword related to the clock, perhaps "BERLINCLOCK" or "MENGENLEHREUHR", but that seems too long.

Alternatively, maybe the keyword is "KRYPTOS" again, but that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the keyword is "CLOCK" for passage 4.

Let's try decrypting "MZFPK" with keyword "CLOCK".

M (13) - C (3) = J (10)

Z (26) - L (12) = X (24)

F (6) - O (15) = negative, wrap around: F (6) + 26 - O (15) = 17 (Q)

P (16) - C (3) = N (13)

K (11) - K (11) = A (0)

So, decrypted letters: J X Q N A, which doesn't match "CLOCK". So, that's not it.

Maybe the keyword is "BERLIN".

M (13) - B (2) = K (11)

Z (26) - E (5) = V (22)

F (6) - R (18) = negative, wrap around: F (6) + 26 - R (18) = 14 (O)

P (16) - L (12) = E (4)

K (11) - I (9) = B (2)

So decrypted letters: K V O E B, which doesn't match "CLOCK".

Hmm.

Perhaps it's a different cipher altogether.

Another thought: maybe it's a Caesar cipher with a shift of 6, as suggested by the coordinates in passage 2 (38°57′6.5″N), but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe it's a reverse cipher, reading the letters backwards.

Let's try that with "NYPVTT" -> "TTVPYN", which doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps it's a Caesar cipher with a shift based on the letters' positions in the alphabet.

But that seems too vague.

I need to think differently.

Given that the user insists it's easy and doesn't require high-level math, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Maybe it's a simple substitution where each letter is shifted by a certain number, and I just need to find that shift.

But as we've seen, the shifts aren't consistent.

Wait a minute, what if it's a keyword cipher where the keyword is "EAST" based on the clue "FLRV" -> "EAST"?

If I use "EAST" as the keyword for a Vigenère cipher, let's try decrypting "NYPVTT".

N Y P V T T

E A S T E A

So, shift values: E(5), A(1), S(19), T(20), E(5), A(1)

Decrypt:

N (14) - E (5) = J (9)

Y (25) - A (1) = X (24)

P (16) - S (19) = negative, wrap around: P (16) + 26 - S (19) = 13 (N)

V (22) - T (20) = C (2)

T (20) - E (5) = O (15)

T (20) - A (1) = S (19)

So decrypted letters: J X N C O S, which doesn't make sense.

Not "BERLIN".

Hmm.

Maybe the keyword is "NORTHEAST".

That's longer, so let's see.

N O R T H E A S T

But "NYPVTT" is only 6 letters, so using "NORTH" as the keyword for this segment.

N Y P V T T

N O R T H E

Shifts: N(14), O(15), R(18), T(20), H(8), E(5)

Decrypt:

N (14) - N (14) = A (0)

Y (25) - O (15) = J (10)

P (16) - R (18) = negative, wrap around: P (16) + 26 - R (18) = 14 (O)

V (22) - T (20) = C (2)

T (20) - H (8) = S (12)

T (20) - E (5) = O (15)

So decrypted letters: A J O C S O, which isn't "BERLIN".

Not matching.

This is frustrating. I must be missing something obvious.

Wait, maybe it's a cipher where letters are shifted based on their position in the word.

For "NYPVTT" to "BERLIN":

Position 1: N -> B (shift -12)

Position 2: Y -> E (shift -20)

Position 3: P -> R (shift +2)

Position 4: V -> L (shift -10)

Position 5: T -> I (shift -11)

Position 6: T -> N (shift -6)

These shifts don't follow a pattern based on position.

Another angle: perhaps it's a cipher that uses the Berlin Clock's time display to shift letters.

For example, using the current time to determine shift values, but without a specific time, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the sculpture's creation date or a significant date is used as part of the cipher.

Given that the sculpture was dedicated in 1990, perhaps the shift is based on that year, but again, that seems too vague.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the entire ciphertext and see if there are any repeating patterns or common letter groupings that could give me a clue.

Looking at the ciphertext:

"OBKR UOXOGHULBSOLIFBBWFLRVQQPRNGKSSO TWTQSJQSSEKZZWATJKLUDIAWINFBNYP VTTMZFPKWGDKZXTJCDIGKUHUAUEKCAR"

I notice that "QQPRNGKSSO" decrypts to "NORTHEAST", which is a direction, and "FLRV" decrypts to "EAST", another direction. This suggests that directions play a role in the cipher.

Maybe the letters are shifted based on compass directions, with each direction corresponding to a shift value.

For example:

- North: shift +0

- East: shift +90

- South: shift +180

- West: shift +270

But that seems too simplistic and would result in shifts beyond the 26-letter alphabet.

Alternatively, perhaps each direction corresponds to a shift of a certain number of letters, like North = shift +1, East = shift +2, etc.

But without knowing the exact mapping, that's speculative.

Wait, the clue mentions "NORTHEAST," which is a combination of North and East. Maybe it's a combination of shift values for those directions.

This is getting too convoluted. I need a simpler approach.

Given that the user insists it's easy and that they've solved it, perhaps there's a straightforward substitution that I'm overlooking.

Let me try a simple Caesar shift of, say, shift -6, as a random guess.

Take "OBKR":

O (15) -6 = I (9)

B (2) -6 = wrap around: Z (26)

K (11) -6 = E (5)

R (18) -6 = L (12)

So, "OBKR" -> "IZE L"

That doesn't make sense.

Shift of -10:

O (15) -10 = E (5)

B (2) -10 = wrap around: Q (17)

K (11) -10 = A (1)

R (18) -10 = I (8)

So, "OBKR" -> "E Q A I"

Still not meaningful.

Shift of -4:

O (15) -4 = K (11)

B (2) -4 = wrap around: X (24)

K (11) -4 = G (7)

R (18) -4 = N (14)

"OBKR" -> "KXGN"

Nope.

This isn't working. Maybe it's not a Caesar shift.

Another idea: perhaps it's an anagram.

Looking at "OBKR UOXOGHULBSOLIFBBWFLRVQQPRNGKSSO TWTQSJQSSEKZZWATJKLUDIAWINFBNYP VTTMZFPKWGDKZXTJCDIGKUHUAUEKCAR", rearranging letters to form meaningful words.

But with 97 letters, that's a massive anagram to solve manually.

Not practical.

I need to think differently. Since Sanborn is an artist, perhaps the solution is more artistic than cryptographic.

Maybe the letters correspond to something visual, like a map or a code based on the sculpture's design.

But without seeing the sculpture, it's hard to apply that knowledge.

Wait, the user mentioned that the solution is easy and doesn't require high-level math, so perhaps it's a simple substitution where each letter corresponds to another based on a basic pattern.

Given that "FLRV" -> "EAST", let's see the positions:

F (6) -> E (5): shift -1

L (12) -> A (1): shift -11 or +15

R (18) -> S (19): shift +1

V (22) -> T (20): shift -2

No consistent shift again.

Alternatively, maybe it's a keyboard shift, where letters are shifted on the QWERTY keyboard.

For example, F is next to G, but that doesn't help.

Not seeing a pattern.

Perhaps it's a letter-to-number-to-letter substitution, using the atomic numbers of elements or something like that, but that seems too complex.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, maybe I should accept that I'm not seeing the obvious solution and try a different approach.

Perhaps the key is to focus on the words that have been decrypted and see if they lead to the next step.

From the decrypted parts:

- "BERLIN"

- "CLOCK"

- "NORTHEAST"

- "EAST"

Putting these together, maybe it's pointing to a specific location in Berlin related to a clock.

The most famous clock in Berlin is the Brandenburg Gate's clock or the previously mentioned Mengenlehreuhr.

But Sanborn mentioned there are several interesting clocks in Berlin, so it might not be the most obvious one.

Alternatively, maybe it's referencing the "Berlin Clock" in a metaphorical sense, not a physical clock.

Wait, considering that "CLOCK" is decrypted from "MZFPK", and "CLOCK" is part of the decrypted message, maybe the cipher itself is time-based or cyclical like a clock.

Perhaps it's a rotational cipher where letters are shifted in a cyclical manner, similar to how clock hands move.

If I consider a rotational shift based on the number of letters in "CLOCK" (5 letters), maybe shifting each letter by 5 positions.

Let's try that with "NYPVTT":

N (14) -5 = I (9)

Y (25) -5 = T (20)

P (16) -5 = K (11)

V (22) -5 = P (16)

T (20) -5 = O (15)

T (20) -5 = O (15)

So, "NYPVTT" -> "ITKPOO", which isn't "BERLIN".

Not matching.

Maybe shifting forward:

N (14) +5 = S (19)

Y (25) +5 = D (30 -> D-26=4)

P (16) +5 = U (21)

V (22) +5 = A (27 -> A-26=1)

T (20) +5 = Y (25)

T (20) +5 = Y (25)

So, "NYPVTT" -> "S D U A Y Y", which doesn't make sense.

Still not "BERLIN".

This is getting me nowhere. I need to think outside the box.

Perhaps the solution isn't a traditional cipher but something more abstract, like taking the first letters of certain words or using the letters to represent something else entirely.

Given that Sanborn is an artist, maybe the solution is a visual code or something that requires interpreting the sculpture's design elements.

But without access to the sculpture's design, that's not feasible.

Another thought: maybe the letters correspond to numbers on a telephone keypad, and those numbers form a phone number or coordinates.

For example:

O - 6

B - 2

K - 5

R - 7

So, "OBKR" -> 6,2,5,7

But that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, using their positions in the alphabet:

O(15), B(2), K(11), R(18)

15, 2, 11, 18

Still not meaningful.

Wait, perhaps adding the numerical positions:

15 + 2 + 11 + 18 = 46

But 46 what? Doesn't help.

This is really frustrating. I feel like I'm missing something obvious.

Maybe I should look at the entire decrypted message and see if it forms a sentence or a clue.

Given that, perhaps the decrypted passage 4 leads to a location or another cipher.

But without decrypting it, I can't know.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I might have to concede that I can't solve this right now. Maybe with more time and a different perspective, I'll figure it out later.
